# untangling-conditionals

I wanted to try following along with [this refactoring blog post](https://cloudnative.ly/refactoring-untangling-conditionals-cc5693b8ec3c) but in Javascript

## Using this app to practise refactoring

This app has been configured to run the tests in `test/pipeline.test.js` after every edit.
That means all you need to do is:

1. Remix this app
2. Open the Tools, then Logs in your new app to see the test output
3. Get refactoring - after each edit you can see if any tests are failing in the Logs
